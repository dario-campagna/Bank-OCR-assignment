# Bank OCR assignment

Work in a small group (2 to 5 people) on the [Bank OCR kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/) by using Java, Gradle and practice Continuous 
Integration.

Under [Projects](https://github.com/dario-campagna/Bank-OCR-assignment/projects) you can find two projects presenting the Bank OCR kata in terms of user stories (using GitHub issues). They are examples of the use of GitHub Projects and Issues to organize and manage the work on a repository. You can create a similar project for your repository if you like.
