# Bank OCR assignment

Work in a small group (2 to 5 people) on the [Bank OCR kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/) by using Java, Gradle, and practice Continuous 
Integration.

You can configure CircleCI on your forked repositroy to set up a CI system.

Under [Projects](https://github.com/dario-campagna/Bank-OCR-assignment/projects) you can find two projects, one classic and one "new", that present the Bank OCR kata in terms of user stories (using GitHub Issues). They are examples of the use of GitHub Projects and Issues to organize and manage the work on a repository. Both projects reference the same issues. You can create a similar project for your repository if you like.

The first user story is done. There are two (disabled) acceptance tests related to the next issues you can work on.
