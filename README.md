[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dario-campagna/Bank-OCR-assignment.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dario-campagna/Bank-OCR-assignment)

Work in a small group (2 to 5 people) on the [Bank OCR kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/) by using Java, Gradle and Travis CI.

The [Bank OCR project](https://github.com/dario-campagna/bank-ocr-assignment/projects/1) presents the Bank OCR kata in terms of issues. It's an example of the use of GitHub Projects and Issues to organize and manage the work on a repository. You can create a similar project for your repository if you like.
